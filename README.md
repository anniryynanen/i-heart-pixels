This project is a work in progress. It may slowly be becoming a pixel graphics editor.

To run the project, download the ZIP from behind the green "Code" button above. Extract it and go to the folder with the README file. Get Godot from https://godotengine.org/ and add it to the folder. Run the Godot file and the app will launch!
